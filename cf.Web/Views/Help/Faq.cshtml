    <h2>3) Adding Places + Mapping</h2>
            
    <h3>3.1 What is the distinction between 'Areas' and 'Locations'</h3>

@*    <p>An area is represented by boundaries. It is something you pass through and can say you are '<b>in</b> an Area'. A Location is a single 
    point (on the earth it is represented with a latitude
    & longitude). It is a final destination and you can say I am '<b>at</b> a Location' where someone can meet you. On Climbfind we think of
    a 'Climbing Area' as a bounded region that contains 'Climbing Locations' that people associate with the name of that area.</p>
*@
    <div style="float:left;width:47%;padding-right:10px">
    <p style="margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px"><b style="color:Black">An area</b> has boundaries. It is something you pass through. 
    You can say you are <b>'in an area'</b>.  Provinces, cities, towns, parks, beaches, national parks & climbing places like Yosemite 
    & Squamish are examples of areas. Areas can also have sub areas.</p>
    @*<p>On Climbfind we add <i>locations</i> to <i>areas</i>.</p>*@
    <img src="@Stgs.StaticRt/map/AreaExample.PNG" style="margin:10px 0px" />
    </div>
    <div style="float:left;width:48%;border-left:solid 1px gray;padding-left:20px">
    <p style="margin-top:0px;padding-top:0px"><b style="color:Black">A location</b> is a single point. It is a final 
    destination. You can say you are <b>'at a location'</b> and someone can meet you there. An indoor climbing gym is an <i>location</i>. 
    Single Outdoor rock walls & single boulders are locations. If the place you're thinking of has multiple
    walls and/or boulders - it's an area.</p>
    @* <p>On Climbfind we add <i>climbs</i> to <i>locations</i>.</p>*@
    <img src="@Stgs.StaticRt/map/PointExample.PNG" style="margin:10px 0px"  /></div>

    <hr />
    <p>Put simplistically climbing 'areas' contain climbing 'locations' and climbing location have 'climbs'. 
    The only tricky thing to know is <b>one climbing location
    can belong to multiple areas</b>. If you think about it, that makes complete sense... Pretend your home was
    a climbing location. It belongs both to your province (state) and your city. That's because these two areas overlap. Overlapping
    areas are completely natural - it's the way we see the world! Hence when you add areas on Climbfind often you will add a big area first and
    subsequently add sub-areas.</p>
    <p>When adding outdoor climbing areas, we recommend you use a guidebook as a guide rather than making up areas yourself.</p>


    <h3>How do I know if I'm adding an area or a location?</h3>

    <p>A location is a single rock wall or boulder with it's own name and climbs. So if the place you are adding, 
    would in a guidebook be split into multiple spots with different names for each, you would add the place as an 'Area' and
    subsequently add each named rock wall / boulder as a 'location' to that area.</p>

    @*<h4>When I add an area, I can't move the box around, I can only shrink and make it bigger? Why can't I move it around so that it covers the
    area I want accurately?</h4>

    <p>There are two parts to answers to this. The first answer is that the center of the box has been suggested by bing/google. This means that there is
    a culturally established and accepted center point for the place you're adding that is more accurate that the one you think best represents
    the center. By accepting what google suggests we can also avoid problems with duplicates because we can check if any other areas have been suggested
    at the same center.</p>

    <p>The other part is that whilst the accuracy of the center point is very important, the distance the area covers is less important. 
    The only thing you need to make sure is that the box covers all the climbing that is associated with the name of the area you are adding. It's completely fine if
    the majority of the climbing happens to fall in the top right corner of the box, so long as the box covers all the climbing.</p>

    <h3>When I type in the name of the area I want to add bing/google cannot find any results? What do I do now?</h3>

    <p>We'll most likely change this workflow and the terms we use very soon to be a bit more user friendly!</p>
            
    <p> For now return to the page of the 'parent area' that you want to
    add the area too. If there is no parent area then you need to add one. For example if there is a well known National Park that contains
    the Climbing Area you want to add, add that first. Once you are on the page of the 'parent area', look down the right and find the
        link that says 'Add a sub climbing area'. This screen will give you complete control over the name, bounds and center or 
        the area you are adding.</p>

        <h4>How do I add information about things like camp sites, car parks and approaches?</h4>

        <p>Climber Points of interest, approaches and climbs are coming in a future release of cf2011. Depending on how quickly
        the team gets the hang of adding area, gyms and outdoor locations well get these features up and running when the team is ready to
        start adding them.</p>*@
